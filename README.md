# Harvard's CS50x 2021

All labs and problems were solved during 8 weeks in autumn 2021, but I did not have the time to build the final project until summer 2023. Therefore I had to resubmit and adjust some of my old solutions and decided to keep it here all together.

**!! DO NOT COPY THIS SOLUTIONS !!**

</br>

You will learn NOTHING if you copy solutions without experiencing the journey yourself...
